computer architecture and operating systems
systems 1

high level overview of computer architecture
operation systems

operating system
  discipline arose historically from a set of problems
  make computer easier to use


analog continuous set of values, digit is very specific values

emacs editor
Core dump, take memory of computer and dump it in a file
core - memory in a system
moore's law - computers get faster roughly every two years
  twice as many transistors in same amount of space

multiprograming - more memory available can load several jobs at once

virtual memory
integrated circuit - IC , transistors put together to do a specific job in the hardware, pre built into the IC

preemptive multitasking
  run all programs at same time , one after another switching between programs really

word - one chunk of memory to store data, how many bits in it? a byte is 8 bits, a word is 32 bits 4 bytes

response time and thrashing
  - one program swapping out with a different program over and over again and not getting its work done
os will limit number of switches

Embedded systems - computer that doesn't run general purpose software

cloud computing

operating system
interface between user and hardware
simpler virtual machine interface
hides ugly details of real hardware
manages shared resources

to do:
lab - c programming
